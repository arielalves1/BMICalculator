# About this project

Introducing my very first full project as a beginner mobile developer - a BMI calculator app for Android! This app was built entirely in Java and features a user-friendly interface with an original XML layout. With this app, users can easily calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) by entering their gender, age, height and weight.


Not only is this app functional, but it also boasts a beautiful UI that I designed. I am proud of the work I have put into this project and excited to share it with others. It is my hope that this app will not only serve as a useful tool for users but also as a testament to my growing skills as a mobile developer.


So, whether you are looking to keep track of your own health and fitness or simply want to explore the world of mobile development, give my BMI calculator app a try (and a star :) )!
